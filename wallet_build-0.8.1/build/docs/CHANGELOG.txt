Feature Funding monitor
-----------------------
    The Funding Monitor feature provides monitoring account balances, and their 
    automated replenishment from a funding account, based on account properties 
    set by the funding account to the monitored accounts. token, asset, or currency 
    balances can be monitored. If a balance falls below the configured threshold, 
    a transaction will be submitted to transfer units from the funding account 
    to the monitored account. A transfer will remain pending if the number of blocks 
    since the previous transfer transaction is less than the interval configured 
    for the monitor. Since funding monitor takes the secret phrase for funding, 
    this feature is restricted to localhost in main net.
    Available Operations:
    - Start a new few funding monitor
    - List funding monitors running on a particular node for the logged in account
    - Stop specific monitor on that node

	The account ledger feature provides a record of all recent changes to the 
	account balances and the event that caused each change. It is disabled by 
	default for all account, but can be set to track certain accounts only or 
	be enabled for all accounts (*), using the xin.ledgerAccounts property. 
	By default records are kept for the last 30,000 blocks, this can be changed 
	using the xin.ledgerTrimKeep property. The xin.ledgerLogUnconfirmed property 
	controls whether confirmed, unconfirmed, or both types of changes are tracked.

Support for prunable attachmnent messages
-----------------------------------------
	Prunable encrypted messages were enabled in wallet and therefore activated
	in core. The maximum size for each such attachment is 42 kb., but when 
	coexisting in the same transaction the sum of the two is still being limited 
	by the maximum payload size of 44880 bytes. The fee for prunable messages are
    1 token. Prunable messages are deleted after 14 days but nodes can act as
    prunable message archive and permanent storage.

Added ledger view
------------------
	The account ledger feature provides a record of all recent changes to the 
	account balances and the event that caused each change. It is disabled by 
	default for all account, but can be set to track certain accounts only or 
	be enabled for all accounts (*), using the xin.ledgerAccounts property. 
	By default records are kept for the last 30,000 blocks, this can be changed 
	using the xin.ledgerTrimKeep property. The xin.ledgerLogUnconfirmed property

    node should enable ledger for it to retrieve it.


AT creations, list and relevant modals
--------------------------------------
	An Automated Transaction is a "Turing complete" set of byte code instructions 
	which will be executed by a byte code interpreter. Code in an AT will be run by 
    an AT byte code interpreter (a virtual CPU) which will use a fixed amount of 
    memory per program. 
	Available Operations:
    - Create AT
	- View All ATs
	- View MyAts


AT workbench adjustment
-----------------------
	Utilities for creating ATs. These includes compiler decompiler converter 
    templates and debugger. 


Support shufflings
------------------
	Coin shuffling can be used to perform mixing of XIN, MS currencies (unless
	created as non-shuffleable), or AE assets. Any account can create a new
	shuffling, specifying the holding to be shuffled, the shuffle amount, number
	of participants required, and registration deadline. This is done using the
	shufflingCreate API. The Shuffler is required to keep the user secret phrase 
	in memory, therefore it should be run on a trusted local machine only.
	This feature is based on the paper by Tim Ruffing. Since shuffling takes the 
	secret phrase, this feature is restricted to localhost in main net.


Pending actions indicator
-------------------------
	Added approval, escrow, subscription and news indicator to navbnar. Now all 
    pending phased account approvals, escrow approvals and subscription counts 
    are showed
